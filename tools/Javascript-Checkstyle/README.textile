h1. History

Javscript-Checkstyle is a "fork" of dojo util.checkstyle.  They had all the right pieces in place to make a generic Javascript checkstyle application, but needed someone to take it the next step.

h1. Plan

The plan is to have a tool and tasks/plugins for "ant":http://ant.apache.org/ and "maven":http://maven.apache.org that can be integrated into your build lifecycle similar to "phpcs":http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/redirected and "checkstyle":http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/.
