Builds tailed with '4' are built on .Net 4.0, the reset are 3.5sp1.
Each directory contains a self contained binary and an accompanying configuration file.
The different builds are intended as a convenience. The binary files are not dependent
upon each other.

CassiniDev.exe and CassiniDev4.exe are suitable as standalone interactive server for 
hosting all types of web content including static files, ASP.Net content, and WCF. 
Note: WCF is hostable only on localhost due to a limitation of the SimpleWorkerRequest.

CassiniDev-console.exe and CassiniDev4-console.exe are provided primarily to support an
out-of-process testing fixture but may be used to host content just the same if desired.

CassiniDev-lib.dll and CassiniDev4-lib.dll provide a platform for easily and elegantly 
embedding ASP.Net hosting. This can be useful for testing amongst other things.

WebDev.WebServer.EXE, WebDev.WebServer20.EXE and WebDev.WebServer40.EXE are simply 
CassiniDev.exe and CassiniDev4.exe built with a different name to facilitate drop-in 
replacement of the Visual Studio development server.

The only external dependency is optional System.Data.SQLite to enable persistent
logging. Without this provider traffic is only captured when the log window is active
and is discarded when the window is closed. When SQLite is absent all traffic monitored
is stored in memory and it may be wise to occasionally close the window or clear the log
if you are dealing with heavy content.

To replace your instances of Visual Studio 2008/2010 development server(s) simply drop
the corresponding files into place. Be sure to make a copy of the existing files and
clearly mark them as original so that you may replace them should there be a problem
with CassiniDev.

You will find the Visual Studio development servers in the following directories:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\DevServer\9.0   <-- Visual Studio 2008
C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\DevServer\10.0  <-- Visual Studio 2010
